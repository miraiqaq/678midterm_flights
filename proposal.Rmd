##1.Introduction

Every year in the United State of America, millions of passengers experience delays in flights, resulting in missing flights connections and distract the valuable time for people. Airlines wonâ€™t tell you if your flight is likely to be delayed or not.

##2.Objective
In this analysis, I try to develop a Multilevel regression model that aims to predict if a flight arrival will be delayed by 15 minutes or more which departed from Atlanta.

##3.Data Preparation
The 3 datasets I will use can be found & downloaded by navigating to the following link:
-flights.csv & airlines.csv 
  https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp
-weather.csv:
  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

The raw flight dataset contains 621,462 observations and 29 variables for US flights in January 2018. 
```{r}
setwd("/Users/CindyWang/Desktop/678/midterm project")
flights <- read.csv("flights.csv")
library(dplyr)
glimpse(flights)
```

The raw weather dataset has 729 observations and 22 variables. For future analysis, I will join flight and weather datasets by date. Some of key variable will use are:

  WT01-Fog,ice fog,or freezing fog(may include heavy fog)
  
  WT02-Heavy fog or heavy freezing fog(not always distinguished from fog)
  
  WT03-Thunder
  
  WT05-Hail(may include small hail)
  
  WT08-Smoke or haze
  
  SNOW-snow fall
  
  AWND-average wind speed
  
  TAVG-average temperature
  
  PRCP-precipitation
  
The airlines.csv contains translation between two letter rrier code and names of US airlines. I will aldo join this with flights dataset.

##4.Next Steps
-Clean Data

-Exploratory Data Analysis

-Modeling and Prediction

-Model Check
